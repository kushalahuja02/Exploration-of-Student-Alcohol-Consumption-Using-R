## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
rm(list = ls())
#importing the dataset 

StudentConsumption <- read.csv("/Users/ahuja/Desktop/student-mat.csv",stringsAsFactors = F,header=T)

#Performing Exploratory Data Analysis

#str() function is used to know the structure of the dataset i.e. datatypes of the variables included in the dataset  

str(StudentConsumption)

#summary() function is used to know the brief introduction of the dataset 

summary(StudentConsumption)

#Returns the first n rows of the dataset 
head(StudentConsumption) 

#Return the last n rows of the dataset
tail(StudentConsumption)

#ncol() function is showing the number of columns present in the dataset 
paste("Number of Columns in the Dataset are- ", ncol(StudentConsumption))

#nrow() funtion is showing the number of rows present in the  data set
paste("Number of Rows in the Dataset are- ", nrow(StudentConsumption))

#dim() function is used to state the dimension of the dataset i.e. columns and rows in one output 
paste("Dimensions of the Dataset - ",dim(StudentConsumption))

#checking the missing values 
which(is.na(StudentConsumption)) 

sum(is.na(StudentConsumption))

#Since there is no missing values, deplopying it for making the Interactive web app using Shiny. 

```

```{r}
#loading the required libraries 

library(shiny)
library(shinythemes)
library(ggplot2)

#making the UI dashboard by ShinyUI 
UI <- shinyUI(fluidPage(theme =shinytheme("superhero"), #superhero theme is used for the app
                        navbarPage("Consumption of Alcohol by Students"), #navbarpage is used as so to add more more pages in the single dashboard in future
                        
  titlePanel("Alcohol Consumption of Students in respect of Grades, Family Status and Gender"),
   headerPanel("Analysing the Student's Alcohol Consumption"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
     
      helpText("Input parameters"), #describing for parameters or sidepanels to the user
      
sliderInput(inputId="bins",  label = "Number of Bins",
    min = 0, max = 50, value = 25, step = 5),  #making the sliderinput for bins

 radioButtons("var",label = "Select the Grade", choices = c("G1", "G2", "G3"),
  selected = "G1"), #making a radiobutton for selecting Grades in the datset
      
  selectInput(inputId="famsup",
               label="Educational Support from Family",
              choices = c("Yes","No"),
         selected="Yes"),  #making a selectInput for selecting the binary data of famsup column

   radioButtons("gender",label="Choose a Gender",  choices=c("Male","Female"),
                selected="Male"), #making a radioButton for selecting the gender 

 sliderInput(inputId="famrel",  
             label="Quality of RelationShip with Family",
             min = 1, max = 5,value = 3),  #making a sliderInput for famrel which describes the relationship with the family from 1 being poor to 5 meaning Good

 ),
    
    mainPanel(plotOutput("plot"))
)
))


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

plotting <- function(var,titlePlot,color,abins) #plotting is called 
{
  names(var)<- c("Sex","famsup","famrel","Dalc","grade") #adding the attributes to the var
  var <- var[,c(-1,-2,-3)]  #for plotting , taking the Dalc and grade attribute
  
  var$Dalc <- as.factor(var$Dalc) #changing the datatype

graph2 <- ggplot(var, aes(x=grade, fill=color)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = abins,fill=color)+ ggtitle(titlePlot) +theme( plot.title = element_text(size=15, face="bold")+facet_wrap(~ grade, scale="free_y") +facet_grid(Dalc~.))   #plotting by using ggplot

graph2

}
Server <- shinyServer(
 function(input, output) {
output$plot <- renderPlot({  
      
color <- switch(input$var, "G1" = "#FF9999", "G2" = "#56B4E9",
                      "G3" = "#009E73")
dataset <- switch(input$var,"G1" = StudentConsumption[,c(2,17,24,27,31)],"G2" = StudentConsumption[,c(2,17,24,27,32)],"G3" = StudentConsumption[,c(2,17,24,27,33)] )
      
title <- switch(input$var, "G1"="Alcohol Consumption of Grade 1 Students",
    "G2"=" Alcohol Consumption of Grade 2 Students",
  "G3"=" Alcohol Consumption of Grade 3 Students")

 dataset <- switch(input$famsup,
                   "Yes"=subset(dataset,famsup=="yes"),
                 "No"=subset(dataset ,famsup=="no"))
title <- switch(input$famsup,
             "Yes"=paste(title,"who have education support from family"),
            "No"=paste(title,"who do not have education support from family"))
             
 dataset <- switch(input$gender,"Male"=subset(dataset,sex=="M"),
                            "Female"=subset(dataset,sex=="F"))
title <- switch(input$gender,'Male'=paste(title,"are Male Students"),
                      "Female"=paste(title,"are Female Students"))
        
dataset <- switch(input$famrel,
                     "Not good"=subset(dataset ,famrel==1),
                     "Average"=subset(dataset,famrel==2),
                     "Good"=subset(dataset,famrel==3),
                     "Excellent"= subset(dataset,famrel==4),
                     "Great"=subset(dataset,famrel==5))
title <- switch(input$famrel,
       "Not good"=paste(title," and Donot have good relationship with their family" ),
       "Minimal"=paste(title,"and Have Minimal Connection with their family"),
      "Average"=paste(title,"and Have an Average Relationship with their family"),
      "Good"= paste(title,"and Have a Good Relationship with their family"),             
      "Great"= paste(title,"and Have a Great Relationship with their family"))


 plotting(var = dataset, titlePlot=title,color = color, abins = input$bins)
 })
}
)


shinyApp(ui= UI, server= Server)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
